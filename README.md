LMA Groupproject - sharing codes 
1. sharing code, professor instruction and github instructions in different files, please pull all the file to your R. 
2. Because the data is too big, so I suggest that you should put the original data into the file
3. Everytime, please pull the files from Github first, then push. Otherwise you may face some problems. 
4. Welcome to use Master branch together, or you can create your own branch. It's up to you.
