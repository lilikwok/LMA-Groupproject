LMA Groupproject - sharing codes 
1. sharing code, professor instruction and github instructions in different files, please pull all the file to your R. 
2. Because the data is too big, so I suggest that you should put the original data into the file
3. Everytime, please pull the files from Github first, then push. Otherwise you may face some problems.
